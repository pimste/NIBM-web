# Conversion-Focused SEO Strategy

## Goal: Generate Crane Inquiries, Not Just Traffic

This SEO implementation is specifically optimized to convert visitors into crane inquiries (sales and rentals).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Conversion-Focused Keywords
- **Before**: Generic keywords like "tower crane", "construction equipment"
- **After**: High-intent keywords like:
  - "buy tower crane"
  - "tower crane for sale"
  - "tower crane rental quote"
  - "tower crane price"
  - "contact crane dealer"

### 2. Meta Descriptions with CTAs
- **Before**: Descriptive only
- **After**: Include call-to-action:
  - "Contact us for pricing and availability."
  - "Get a free rental quote today."

### 3. Inquiry-Optimized Schema Markup
- Added `Offer` schema for sales (with pricing)
- Added `Service` schema for rentals (with contact info)
- Added `ContactPoint` schema for easy inquiry

### 4. Title Tags with Intent
- **Before**: "Crane Name - Tower Crane Details"
- **After**: "Crane Name - Tower Crane For Sale" or "Tower Crane Rental"

## How It Works

### For Sales Pages:
1. Keywords prioritize "buy", "sale", "price"
2. Meta description includes "Contact us for pricing"
3. Offer schema shows availability and pricing
4. Contact form pre-filled with crane details

### For Rental Pages:
1. Keywords prioritize "rental", "quote", "hire"
2. Meta description includes "Get a free rental quote"
3. Service schema shows rental availability
4. Contact form emphasizes quote request

## Expected Results

### Search Intent Matching:
- Users searching "tower crane for sale" → See "For Sale" in title
- Users searching "crane rental quote" → See "Get a free quote" in description
- Users searching "buy tower crane" → See pricing/contact CTAs

### Conversion Improvements:
- Higher click-through rates (CTR) from search results
- More qualified traffic (buying intent)
- More form submissions
- More phone calls and emails

## Monitoring

Track these metrics:
1. **Form submissions** from crane detail pages
2. **Phone calls** from crane pages
3. **Email inquiries** mentioning specific cranes
4. **Search queries** that lead to conversions
5. **CTR from search** (should increase with better titles/descriptions)

## Next Steps

1. **A/B Test Meta Descriptions**: Test different CTAs
2. **Track Conversion Keywords**: See which keywords convert best
3. **Optimize Landing Pages**: Ensure forms are prominent
4. **Add Urgency**: "Available now", "Limited stock"
5. **Local SEO**: Add city-specific pages for high-intent local searches
