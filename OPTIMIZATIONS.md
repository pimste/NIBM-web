# Performance Optimizations for NIBM Tower Cranes Website

## Bundle Size Optimization
- Added bundle analyzer tool to identify large packages
- Implemented code splitting for homepage components using `dynamic` imports and `Suspense`
- Created optimized animation component (`AnimatedElement.tsx`) to reduce Framer Motion overhead
- Configured package imports optimization in Next.js config for `framer-motion` and `react-icons`

## Image Optimization
- Enhanced Next.js image configuration with:
  - Support for WebP and AVIF formats
  - Responsive image sizes
  - Appropriate caching policies
  - Optimized quality settings
- Added lazy loading script to defer loading of non-critical images
- Preloaded critical images like the hero background and logo
- Created image optimization script for generating optimized versions

## JavaScript Performance
- Reduced client-side JavaScript bundle size through code splitting
- Implemented lazy-loading for components not needed during initial render
- Optimized animations to reduce jank and improve Core Web Vitals
- Used dynamic imports for heavy libraries to reduce initial load
- Set appropriate loading strategies for scripts with `next/script`

## Fonts Optimization
- Implemented proper font loading with `next/font`
- Added font display swap for better rendering
- Limited preloaded font weights to those actually used
- Added font CSS variables for consistent typography

## Caching & Headers
- Set appropriate cache headers for static assets
- Configured security headers for better security practices
- Added preconnect for third-party domains

## Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Optimization
- Prioritized hero image loading with:
  - `priority` attribute
  - `fetchPriority="high"` attribute
  - `quality` settings
  - Blur placeholder
- Simplified hero section to improve rendering speed

## Core Web Vitals Focus
- Reduced Total Blocking Time (TBT) by deferring non-critical JS
- Improved Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by setting explicit dimensions
- Enhanced First Contentful Paint (FCP) with preload directives
- Optimized Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) elements
- Reduced unused JavaScript with code splitting

## Next Steps for Further Optimization
1. Implement server components for data fetching sections
2. Further optimize third-party script loading
3. Add service worker for offline capability and caching
4. Implement HTTP/2 Server Push for critical assets
5. Consider Edge Functions for global performance
6. Add real user monitoring (RUM) to identify additional optimization opportunities
